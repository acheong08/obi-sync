- `cd obsidian-sync`
- `go run cmd/obsidian-sync/main.go`
Optional:
- Configure [nginx](https://github.com/acheong08/rev-obsidian-sync/wiki/Nginx-Configuration)
- HTTPS is recommended.

When you're done, install and configure the [plugin](https://github.com/acheong08/rev-obsidian-sync-plugin)

## Adding a new user

`go run cmd/signup/main.go`

Alternatively:
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://yourdomain.com/user/signup \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"email": "example@example.com",
	"password": "example_password",
	"name": "Example User",
	"signup_key": "<SIGNUP_KEY>"
}'
```
You can set the signup key via the `SIGNUP_KEY` environment variable. If it has not been set, you can exclude it from the request.
